# nvidiaProfileInspector-UNLOCKED

This is a repository which contains the unlocked settings of the main NvidiaProfileInspector, some improvements in data loading, reading and drive handling were added, as due to the amount of new options just the normal program was not working properly.

Some of the added options of RTX HDR, DLSS and Dyanmic Vibrance were added thanks to the [neatche repository called nvidiaProfileInspectorForkAIO](https://github.com/neatchee/nvidiaProfileInspectorForkAIO), also thanks to the last updates I got from the original Orbmu2k repository and the contributors.

**How did you get the values?**

There is simply an Nvidia Leak (which is a big part of the code) in which you get the HexID and add it to the `Reference.xml`. In this case, it is not necessary as it is integrated into the program directly.

Clearly, the Leak contains not only this but also much more valuable information. 

If you find any errors, suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me. 

Now, **why was all this done?** Simply so that people can learn and experiment.
